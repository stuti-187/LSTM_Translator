<B>Problem Statement</B>

Travelled to India and having difficulty in comprehending what the pictures, posters or signboards around have written on them? To solve this is the primary purpose of our application. The user has to click a picture with and leave the rest on the application. He will instantly get an English translation of the text written in Hindi. Apart from this, this application is an overall package for a person traveling to India with other features like:
<ul>
<li>He can also input text in English.</li>
<li>He can search the nearby places using his location.</li>
<li>Can make his own travel kit list to keep a track.</li>
</ul>

<B>Introduction</B>

The main reason and objective of this app is to make travelling easier and not letting language be a barrier. The whole application will be using Artificial Intelligence as a backdrop.
The app will be using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to detect the text in the picture clicked which will then be translated using Artificial Intelligence. Other features of the project will require only android studio as a platform.
The artificial intelligence algorithm used in our project is LSTM Neural Network.
